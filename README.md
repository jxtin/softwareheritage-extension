# Browser Extension for Software Heritage 

## Aim : To provide a browser extension which looks up repositories and checks if they are archieved in Software Heritage initially and then add more features.

### Features working right now: 
- Manually click on extension and press try it button to check if it is archieved or not.
- Background.js which checks if active url is part of a list of repository webpages. **WIP**

### Features to be added in future:
- Find out an exhaustive set of websites which are archieved in Software Heritage.
- Add a simple ui for extension and display the results.
- Figure out a way to reduce api calls and make it more efficient.
